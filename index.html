                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <p>I will seek new sources for learning and growth – nature, family, literature, new acquaintances. I will show love rather than expect love. I choose to focus upon being effective versus efficient. I choose to make a difference in this world. To be a person not willing to win at the cost of another’s spirit. To be a person who can feel pain and not want to hurt another. To be the person who speaks for the one that cannot, to listen for the one that cannot hear, see for the one without sight, and have the ability to say, “You did that, not I.”</p>

                <p>My personal vision is to have a life of meaning for myself and others. It is important to me to live my life in a way that shows kindness, care, and concern for family and friends and even strangers. Earn respect for myself based on a recognition of my accomplishments and abilities, maintains a sense of appreciation of the beauty of nature, and a sense of humor.</p>

                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>I want to have a career that includes constant learning and improvement for myself but that also creates an atmosphere of pleasurable learning and improvement for others. I want to work with around people and it is important to me that they like me  but it is even more important to me that they feel that I have helped them in some way – not necessarily that I do a specific good deed, but more that some kindness or thoughtfulness or wisdom of mine has touched them.</p>

                <h1>Work With <span class="highlighted">Passion</span></h1>
                <p>There might be days when your job requires that you make some form of sacrifice. For instance, it might mean that you attend an official event outside your city/state of residence to lend a helping hand. If there is no real passion for your job, this sacrifice will most likely leave you unhappy and make you feel used. The reverse is the case when you are passionate about your job and what you do. You take up those extra responsibilities with a pinch of salt. Your co-workers will see you as a reliable pillar they can always lean on when they need that extra shot of motivation or inspiration.</p>

                <p>Responsibility is important in the workplace because it shows your professionalism, can advance your career, helps build professional bonds with coworkers, and shows company leadership that you are a valuable employee. Supervisors value employees who exhibit responsibility because they know they can trust you to complete tasks on time and submit high-caliber work. Responsible employees are professionals with a consistent work ethic who take actions daily toward their professional goals.</p>
